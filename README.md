# Exploring-Weather-Trends
## Description
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.  My goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in San Francisco where I live. 

## Data Set
